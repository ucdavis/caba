<p><i>Effects of Mouth Closure Dynamics and Lagoon Hydrodynamics on Salmonid Habitat Conditions in Scott Creek Estuary, California. </i>My work investigates patterns in the relationship between freshwater and ocean forces in controlling mouth closure dynamics in small bar-built estuaries typical of the California coast, and to assess to what extend these dynamics drive the hydrological state (in terms of lagoon water level, temperature, salinity, and oxygen) of the estuary, with an eye towards identifying implications for endangered native populations of steelhead and coho that use these important ecosystems as nursery habitat.  Scholarship funds would aid in obtaining the necessary equipment, including time-lapse cameras and water level sensors.</p>

<p><b>Rosemary Hartman</b> was awarded one of two scholarships from the Marin Rod and Gun Club. She is a doctoral candidate in the Ecology Graduate Group and is based in the lab of Dr. Sharon Lawler in the UC Davis Department of Entomology.  Rosemary was awarded the Bob Bittner scholarship in 2012 by the California Fly Fishers Unlimited club.  </p>  

<p><i>Behavior Mechanisms of Coexistence Between the Threatened Cascades Frog and Stocked Trout.</i> Fish stocked in mountain lakes for recreational fisheries provide important resources for rural economies and wilderness conservation.  However, the fish are an introduced predator that can threaten the native community.  I am studying ways in which native species adapt to fish introductions, both through behavioral changes and indirect interactions.  I have been working with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to use my findings to help inform stocking decisions so recreational fisheries can be balanced with biodiversity concerns. </p>

<p><b>Sarah Wheeler</b> was awarded the Bob Wisecarver scholarship from the DiabloValley Fly Fishermen club.  She is a doctoral candidate in the UC Davis Joint Doctorate Program in Ecology with San Diego State University under Dr. Todd Anderson, Dept. of Biology, San Diego State University.  Sarah also conducts research at the UCD Bodega Marine Lab.</p>  

<p><i>The Causes and Consequences of Variation in Larval Traits: A Comparison of Alternative Life History Strategies in Rockfishes.</i>  Understanding the conditions conducive to the recruitment of coastal marine fishes is critical to improve the predictive ability of fisheries management.  The primary objective of my research is to better understand the recruitment of rockfishes by evaluating the biological and oceanographic factors that affect early life stages.  My research evaluates how differential maternal investment, life history strategies, and seasonal timing of birth affect larval condition and survival.  As part of this study, I will characterize the process of settlement and evaluate whether recruitment limitation in this system is driven by coastal oceanography or other factors.
