This is the information required for applying for the Bob Bittner Scholarship provided by the California Fly Fishers’ Unlimited Club of Sacramento. The amount of the single Scholarship is $2,000:
1. Provide your full name, mailing address, phone number and email address.
2. Submit a one to two page description of your research project in non‐ technical terms. Indicate how your research results will aid decision makers in improving the health of fish and fish habitat. Most likely, your description will be evaluated by laypeople not familiar with scientific language. Remember, our Club’s interests are fishing for trout, bass, salmon and similar species in California’s streams, rivers, and lakes in northern California. The closer your research relates to the improvement to the health of these fish and their habitats, the better will be your chances of the award.
3. Identify the need for this funding and how the money would be spent on your research. Please limit this section to one page. Sign the application and email it to Bill Felts at [befelts@yahoo.com](mailto:beflect@yahoo.com)

Note: the application deadline is April 24, 2020.
