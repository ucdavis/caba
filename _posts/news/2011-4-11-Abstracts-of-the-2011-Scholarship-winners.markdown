<p><b><i>Introduced fish in mountain lakes: community changes across stocking levels.</i></b></p>
<p>
I am researching different stocking levels of salmonids in mountain lakes with no native fish. Introduced fishes have a negative impact on some native species, including amphibians of concern.  I am studying these impacts over a gradient of stocking densities to see if fish can coexist with native species at low densities. This will allow managers to strike a balance between providing for a recreational fishery and allowing the native ecosystem to persist. I am seeking funding to pay for research supplies, transportation to my field site, and provide living expenses for my field crew while in the back country.

<p><b><i>Green World Hypothesis test in an aquatic ecosystem.</i></b></p>
<p>
Stream trout have three main food sources: aquatic invertebrate drift, terrestrial invertebrate drift, and aquatic insect emergencies. My research will improve understanding of trout food supply by determining why aquatic invertebrates drift downstream a behavior that increases invertebrate vulnerability to fish predation. More specifically, I will determine the relative importance of invertebrate drift causes, how the relative importance of those causes vary seasonally, and if predators or food are more limiting to stream herbivores (a primary prey item of trout). The funds would pay for travel to and from my Eastern Sierra field site, research station rent, and field supplies.

<p><b><i>New Zealand mudsnails accelerate leaf litter decomposition: does leaf diversity matter?</i></b></p>
<p>
The organizations funding the CABA Scholarship are dedicated to preserving and enhancing Californiaâ€™s aquatic habitats. Invasive species pose an immediate and dangerous threat to the habitats that California fishermen cherish. To prevent the spread of invasive species, including aquatic mollusks such as the New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) we must understand how these organisms change our ecosystems. Data from research studies, including the one I propose here, will inform management strategies and the public. The CABA Scholarship will finance leaf tissue nutrient analysis in order to better understand how the New Zealand mudsnail alter riparian leaf litter decomposition.
