<p>PROGRAM <br />A grand experiment in species conservation is underway on the Yolo Bypass, a farmed floodway of the Sacramento River. Rather than restore the engineered floodplain to some natural state, researchers are exploring possibilities of a re-­‐engineered human-­‐dominated landscape that allows native species to coexist. Engineers, ecologists and economists discuss how habitat for fish and fowl might be reconciled with floods and farming.</p>
