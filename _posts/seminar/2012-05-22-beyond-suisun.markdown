<p>River and ocean waters mix in estuaries, yielding complex and productive aquatic environments.&nbsp; Estuaries are known to provide valuable habitat for many different taxa, including fish and specifically for juvenile salmonids.&nbsp; While there are many examples from other estuaries along the west coast, the focus of studies relating to Central Valley stocks has been on the uppermost estuary â€“ primarily in the Delta and Suisun Bay.&nbsp; Far less attention has been given to habitats seaward of Carquinez Strait, where the majority of the San Francisco Bay estuary is found. <br /><br />The aim of this seminar is to question whether we are missing something critical for understanding and managing Central Valley stocks.&nbsp; Presentations will take a comparative approach, looking at juvenile salmonid ecology in other west coast estuaries with a view to identifying key issues in assessing the value and use of estuarine habitats in the San Francisco Bay estuary.&nbsp; This will be followed by a panel discussion focused on San Francisco Bay and management needs for information related to juvenile salmonid use of transitional waters between freshwater and saltwater habitats (i.e. , the middle and outer estuary, including the plume region immediately west of the Golden Gate).&nbsp; We aim to capture key issues, unknowns and opportunities for science to support management decisions.</p>
