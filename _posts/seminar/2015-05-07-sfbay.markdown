<p><strong>Seminar Overview:</strong><br />Although climate change is one of many threats facing the San Francisco Bay-Delta region, it has the potential to dramatically alter ecosystem health and function on a vast scale. Among the challenges facing resource managers is to understand what the specific impacts will be and what the options are for managing the mitigation of those impacts. A range of strategies are under consideration for mitigating the impacts of sea level rise, changes in watershed inputs and changes in temperature, salinity and sediment loading. This process requires understanding the expected magnitude of change as well as the responses of different habitats to those changes.<br />The goals of the seminar include updating current understanding of climate impacts based on the recent downscaled projections and information regarding the vulnerability and resilience of both natural and human environments. The most current approaches for climate adaptation and mitigation in response to climate related changes will be discussed. The overall goal is to synthesize ongoing efforts in order to facilitate efforts to develop a broader vision for the Bay-Delta ecosystem under future climate scenarios.</p>
