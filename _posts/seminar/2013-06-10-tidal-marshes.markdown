<p> <strong>ABSTRACT</strong><br />The release of the draft Bay-Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) adds urgency to the need to more fully understand how habitat in the Delta can be “restored” to benefit native fishes. Basically, the purpose of BDCP is to improve delivery of water to parts of the Bay Area, Central Valley and Southern California from the Sacramento River, while also improving conditions for endangered native fishes. A major assumption of current biological opinions and the BDCP is that restoration/construction of thousands of acres of tidal marsh habitat will have major benefits to fish, making up in part for the negative effects of altered flows and water diversions on these fish.<br />To address these issues, this seminar intends to explore the ecological linkages between tidal marshes and fish in the Delta (upper San Francisco Estuary). The speakers will focus on the following questions: <br /><br />1.  How are tidal marshes linked to estuarine productivity, especially of fish? <br />2.  What are the historic and current linkages between tidal marshes and fish production in the Delta? <br />3.  Do pelagic/open water fishes derive population-level benefits from tidal marshes? If so, is there a scale dependence - e.g., a ratio between marsh surface area and open water surface area/volume? <br />4.  What are key remaining information gaps in systems both inside and outside California?<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong> SPEAKERS</strong><br /><strong>Ken Able</strong>, Professor, Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, Rutgers University <br /><br /><strong>Don Baltz</strong>, Professor/Chair, Dept. of Oceanography &amp; Coastal Sciences, Louisiana State University <br /><br /><strong>Larry Brown</strong>, Research Biologist, USGS, California Water Science Center<br /><br /><strong>Peter Goodwin</strong>, Lead Scientist, Delta Science Program <br /><br /><strong>Robin Grossinger</strong>, Senior Scientist, San Francisco Estuary Institute <br /><br /><strong>Bruce Herbold</strong>, Private Consultant (Estuarine Ecology)<br /><br /><strong>Wim Kimmerer</strong>, Professor, SFSU, Romberg Tiburon Center<br /><br /><strong>Peggy Lehman</strong>, Staff Environmental Scientist, CA Dept. of Water Resources <br /><br /><strong>Si Simenstad</strong>, Research Professor, Wetland Ecosystem Team, University of Washington <br /><br /><strong>Carl Wilcox</strong>, Bay Delta Regional Manager, CA Dept. of Fish and Wildlife</p>
