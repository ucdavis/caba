 In 2007, the Public Interest Energy Research Program (PIER) of the 
California Energy Commission (CEC) established the Instream Flow 
Assessment Program (IFAP) through the Center for Aquatic Biology and 
Aquaculture of the University of California, Davis (UCD), to conduct 
research studies that indentify and reduce adverse impacts on aquatic 
species and habitats from instream flow variations caused by the 
operation of California hydropower facilities. In 2008, the first 
request for research proposals was announced and three proposals were 
awarded funding from the PIER Program of the CEC through the UCD-CEC 
IFAP. In 2009, proposals were informally requested and one additional 
proposal was awarded funding.&nbsp; Research projects have been ongoing with 
all projects ending in December 2010. The IFAP Program Management Team 
is organizing this Workshop to disseminate the results of the funded 
research projects to all interested parties.</p>
