<p> <strong>Overview</strong><br />Green and White Sturgeon, two distinct species with disparate life histories, reside in the Sacramento/San Joaquin Watershed and pose different challenges related to conservation and management . Green Sturgeon, a more marine species, migrates in spring to spawn in the headwaters of the Sacramento River before returning to the estuary during the fall. After their eggs hatch, the larvae are transported downstream with juveniles rearing within the Delta and San Francisco Bay. Adults migrate out the Golden Gate and travel northward along the continental shelf to the waters off Washington and Canada. By contrast, White Sturgeon appears to spawn exclusively in the lower Sacramento River watershed and remain within the San Francisco Estuary throughout their lifespan. <br />These coarse and contrasting life history descriptions provide the context for this day-long symposium that will present new information about biology and natural history of these two species. Considerable research has been undertaken to understand the physiology, behavior, and ecology of these species. The goal of this symposium is to shed light on current unknowns, some of which are currently being addressed by new electronic tracking technologies and physiological techniques, and to help guide enhanced management and conservation efforts within the Sacramento/San Joaquin watershed. <br /></p>
